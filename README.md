# Hello-World
This will be a test to learn how to use Github

This is me testing commits.


About myself: At the current time of making this I am 15 and I'm just getting into programming. Specifically game design. Currently I'm working on projects using the Unity engine and using Blender to model certain things. I've always wanted to get into game design and now just seemd like the perfect opportunity to get into programming. I'm also hoping that with this website I will be able to make current and future projects a bit easier.
